1. Every so often the rclone token expires, leading to the ~/students-home/ hanging. Run
	rclone config reconnect me123:
	to fix.
        followed by
	rclone mount me123: ./students-home/ --allow-non-empty &
NOTE: the above only works if fusermount is installed. Check with `which fusermount`. Else
      email the HPCC.

2. Here's the command to put in the crontab (crontab -e) for assignment-t1:

* * * * * /home/me123/markben/scripts/assignment-t1/detect_new_submission.sh > /home/me123/markben/tmp/detect_new_submissiont1.out 2> /home/me123/markben/tmp/detect_new_submissiont1.err
